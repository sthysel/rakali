# Install

Rakali is essentially a OpenCV shim and installs the current (unofficial)
opencv-python wheel from PyPi. If you have a custom OpenCV build, make sure that
installing Rakali does not clobber that. 


## pypi

Rakali is in pypi:

```
$ pip install rakali
```

## Manual install

$ pip install .
```
