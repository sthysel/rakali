Install
=======

Rakali is basically a OpenCV shim. Because many people use their own
builds of OpenCV to enable CUDA or the like, installing Rakali may
interfere with exiting custom OpenCV builds so be sure to verify OpenCV
versions after installing Rakali.

Manual install
--------------

Clone or download this repo and in your virtualenv do:

::

   $ pip install .
